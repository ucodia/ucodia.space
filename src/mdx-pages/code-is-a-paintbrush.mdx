# Code is a Paintbrush

## About the exhibit

Code is a Paintbrush was my first solo exhibit under my artist name, Ucodia. It took place at the Slice of Life gallery in Vancouver, Canada, from June 12 to 17, 2025, reaching about 1,000 visitors.  
  
The exhibit was a showcase and the result of 10 years of exploration since I discovered creative coding. It featured five artworks, three of which were interactive and mostly revolving around the theme of generative art. I also ran an interactive installation focusing on the pen plotter as a creative tool; visitors could generate their own art using my programs and bring their own physical pieces to life with the machine, creating unforgettable and unique memories for the most playful of visitors. The physical space in itself was designed for learning and playing.

By sharing knowledge and creating opportunities to interact, the exhibition aimed to demystify creative coding and stimulate curiosity with fun and accessible new ways to create. Finally, the exhibit showcased my artworks Flowtime and 3615 SLICE, my first pieces to explore a deeper meaning and reflection beyond the playful fun of creative coding.

## Flowtime (2017-2025)  

Flowtime is a thought experiment that challenges our traditional understanding of time. It explores the relationship between our perception of time and our ability to enter flow states. It emerged from a simple observation: becoming aware of time made me lose touch with the present. I wanted a way to decide consciously whether to know the time or remain immersed in the flow.

Although it preserves the 24-hour structure, the order of hours is unpredictable. This uncertainty encourages us to loosen our attachment to time. In the exhibition, I presented Flowtime as an interactive station where visitors could play with the digital algorithm on a vertical screen. Alongside it, I displayed the fully functional physical watches which I wear on a daily basis to embody the experiment.

## 3615 SLICE (2025)

The Minitel network was created in the early 80s in France as the first successful public online network. 3615 SLICE brings this technology back to the present to offer a digital catalog of activities and facts about the Slice of Life gallery.  
  
This artwork was born from my frustration with arbitrary obsolescence. In response, I am pleading for the re-ownership of the devices we pay for and seeding the concept of "programmed renovescence": a movement to reprogram old hardware for modern purposes as a rebellion against e-waste.  
  
The piece has since become my first permanent installation, now visible at Slice of Life in Vancouver.

## CMY Dance (2025) & pen plotters

CMY Dance was born out of exploring vintage graphics using parametric equations. Through the simple addition of frequencies and amplitudes, the code sets in motion a generative and ever-changing landscape, never to be seen again.

I paired this artwork with a pen plotter to demonstrate bridging the digital into the physical. Visitors used a custom interface to generate their own designs and watched the robot materialize them on the spot.

This installation was a novel way for me to interact with the audience and include them in the gallery space, sharing my love for machine art while creating unforgettable, unique memories.

## Infinite Chaos (2024-2025)

Infinite Chaos applies a generative approach to Edward Lorenz’s chaos theory, exploring the visual beauty of unpredictable behavior. Created by mining randomness and algorithmic curation, the work featured four giclée prints displayed alongside a live installation constantly drawing new ephemeral iterations.

## Squircle (2021)

Squircle was born from observing the grid pattern of my bathroom ceiling fan. I programmatically recreated these rounded squares to explore how simple rules can generate a wide array of surprising patterns for the pen plotter. To highlight this origin, I displayed the physical prints directly next to the actual vent that inspired them.

## About the artist

I am Lionel Ringenbach, a.k.a. Ucodia, a contraction of Code and Utopia. Based in Vancouver, I am a creative technology artist utilizing code as a paintbrush to tease curiosity and engage in self-reflection.

Drawing from a background in software engineering, my work bridges the gap between digital algorithms and the physical world. I explore novel ways to bring creative concepts into the tangible, using machines and hardware to demystify the technology that surrounds us.
